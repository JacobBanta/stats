# stats
This is a simulation of a test/quiz with 1000 questions that you guess randomly on. There are 5 answer choices(A-E) for each question.
There are 4 different startegies used.

	Strategy 1: Guess the same answer. For this we will choose answer A.
	Strategy 2: Guess randomly.
	Strategy 3: Guess pseudo-randomly.
	Strategy 4: Guess in an alternating pattern(A,B,C,etc.).

Pseudo randomness in this simulation is roughly what a human would choose and has 2 basic criteria.

	Criteria 1: The same answer cannot be chosen 3 times in a row.
	Criteria 2: If an answer has not been chosen in the last 7 questions, it will be chosen.

This was made to prove that no matter what stategy you choose, the results will be, on average, the same.
